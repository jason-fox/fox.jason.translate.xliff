          The following lines are the origin of "Lorem Ipsum":
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Loves or pursues or desires to obtain <b>pain of itself</b>, because it
            is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and
            pain can procure him some great pleasure.
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
              physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it?
            </p>
            <p>
              But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to
              enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who
              avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
    </body>
